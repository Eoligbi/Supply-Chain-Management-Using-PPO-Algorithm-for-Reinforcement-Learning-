# Supply-Chain-Management-Using-PPO-Algorithm-for-Reinforcement-Learning-
Project Overview.
This project will use RL to optimize the functioning of a supply chain using resource allocation of suppliers, factories, warehouses, and retailers. In an ever-changing environment, RL agent learns to make decisions with minimum cost and with maximum operational efficiency, which entails determining the right movement and storage of goods throughout the supply chain. 

Objective.
The goal of this project is to create a supply chain setup in which each node has its own characteristics and constraints and requirements for operation.
Try out some reinforcement learning utilities and set up an environment that is good for a supply chain. Implement five different reinforcement learning algorithms and compare their performance. This includes the PPO, DDPG, DQN, A2C, and TD3. Have a look at their performance based on factors like cumulative rewards, duration, and require computational power.


Project Components.
1.	Supply Chain Environment:
o	The environment models the supply chain as an interconnected network of nodes (suppliers, factories, warehouses, and retailers) with dynamic states.
o	State space: Describes the status of inventory levels at each node.
o	Action space: Represents decisions related to the allocation and movement of inventory across nodes.
o	Rewards: The agent receives rewards based on how well it minimizes costs (e.g., holding, transportation, shortage costs) while maintaining inventory stability.
2.	Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:
o	PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization): A policy gradient method known for its stability and efficiency in continuous action spaces.
o	DQN (Deep Q-Network): A Q-learning algorithm suited for discrete actions.
o	A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic): A synchronous actor-critic method providing stable learning by balancing bias and variance.
o	DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) and TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG): Algorithms for high-dimensional, continuous action spaces, especially valuable in complex environments like supply chains.
3.	Evaluation and Comparison:
o	After training, each algorithm is evaluated over multiple episodes to analyze its performance on the supply chain environment.
o	Key performance metrics include cumulative rewards, learning stability, and computational efficiency
